## Ingredients

- 198 grams all purpose flour
- 24 grams sugar
- 10 grams baking powder
- 6 grams salt
- 473 grams buttermilk
- 1 large egg
- 42 grams melted unsalted butter

## Method

In a large bowl, lightly whisk together your dry ingredients, **198 grams all purpose flour, 24 grams sugar, 10 grams baking powder, 6 grams salt**.

In another bowl, mix your wet ingredients, **473 grams buttermilk, 1 large egg, 42 grams melted unsalted butter**.

Pour your buttermilk mixture into your dry ingredients. Gently whisk until the batter comes together. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl while you're mixing so you don't have any flour clumps on the sides. Once it's mixed and looks like a lumpy batter, stop mixing. If you over mix, your pancakes will become dense and not fluffy.

Let your batter sit in the fridge for 30-60 minutes.

Heat up a nonstick skillet to medium heat and coat it lightly with oil or butter.

When your pan is heated, make a test pancake. Scoop about a 1/4 cup of batter onto your pan. Use more or less batter depending on how big you want your pancakes to be. When large bubbles rise to the surface, the sides are dull and not longer shiny, and a bit of steam comes off the pancake, give your pancake a flip. The first side usually takes about 3-4 minutes for me, and then 1-2 minutes on the second side.

Both sides should be golden brown, just maybe not your first one because those are almost always splotchy. If needed, adjust your heat to be a little lower or higher depending on how golden your test pancake turned out.

Cook the rest of your pancakes and enjoy with a drizzle of maple syrup, tab of butter, or just devour them as is.
