## Ingredients

### Pork filling:

Mince 2 shallots, finely diced. Heat a saucepan with a bit of boil. Throw in shallots and cook for 5 minutes.

While the shallots are cooking, combine 2 tbs oyster sauce, 2 tbs hoisin sauce, 1 tsp soy sauce, 2 tsp sugar, 1/2 cup water, 2 tbsp cornstarch in a small bowl and mix well.

Once shallots are toasted and fragrant, add 2 cups chopped cha sui and brown for 2-3 minutes.

Pour in soy sauce mixture and turn up the heat to medium-high until it starts to bubble. Let it bubble for 1-2 minutes until the mixture thickens.

Set aside and let cool for later use.

### Tangzhong

Heat **20g bread flour, 27g water, & 60g whole milk** over medium heat in a small pan. Whisk continuously as it cooks until it's a thick paste. Don’t walk away because it cooks up quickly. You'll know it's ready when you run a spatula down the pan and a line holds. Remove from heat & let cool.

### Dough

Combine **cooled tangzhong, 320g bread flour, 9g active dry yeast, 3g fine sea salt, 56g granulated sugar, 120g whole milk, 1 whole egg (room temperature)** in a stand mixer. Mix with dough hook attachment on low until ingredients are mixed and no dry spots are left. Then knead on low for 5 minutes.

Add **42g unsalted butter, softened** in small portions, about 10g at a time. Continue to knead on medium for about 10-13 minutes or until dough is smooth and passes the window pane test.

Proof the dough in a lightly oiled bowl for about 1 hour to 1.5 hours or until doubled in size. At the end of proofing, the dough should pass the poke test.

### Shaping

Line a sheet tray with parchment paper.

Punch down and divide the dough into 9 pieces. Shape them into balls and place them onto the sheet tray with 1 inch space between. Put the sheet tray in the fridge for 10 minutes. This will help make the dough a little less sticky and easier to shape and wrap.

Flatten the dough ball into a circle shaped wrapper with a rolling pin. Make sure the edges are thinner than the center.

Scoop 1 tbs of pork filling onto the center of the dough. Imagine your circle dough is an analog clock. Fold the 12 and 6 o'clock edges to meet, and then pinch together. Repeat with 9 and 3 o'clock. Then 10:30 and 4:30, and 1:30 and 7:30. Pinch all edges together to seal the seams. Make sure the bun is completely sealed so the filling doesn't leak out during the bake. Place the wrapped bun seam-side down.

Repeat with the rest of the dough balls. Then place filled and sealed dough balls seam-side down with 1 inch space between.

Let rise for 20-30 minutes until they’re doubled in size and poofy.

Preheat your oven to 360°F.

Make egg wash by whisking together **1 whole egg & a splash of whole milk** thoroughly.

Lightly brush the tops of the buns with egg wash right before putting them in the oven. It'll give them a nice shine.

Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 25-30 minutes until the tops are golden brown. Let cool for 30 minutes to prevent spilling hot liquid on yourself. Let cool for 15 minutes if you really can't wait.
