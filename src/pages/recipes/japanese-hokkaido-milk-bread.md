## Ingredients

#### Tangzhong:

- 20g bread flour
- 27g water
- 60g whole milk

#### Dough:

- 320g bread flour
- 9g active dry yeast
- 3g fine sea salt
- 120g whole milk
- 56g granulated sugar
- 42g unsalted butter, softened
- 1 whole egg, room temperature

#### Egg wash

- 1 whole egg, room temp
- splash of milk

### Tangzhong

Heat **20g bread flour, 27g water, & 60g whole milk** over medium heat in a small pan. Whisk continuously as it cooks until it's a thick paste. Don’t walk away because it cooks up quickly. You'll know it's ready when you run a spatula down the pan and a line holds. Remove from heat & let cool.

### Dough

Combine **cooled tangzhong, 320g bread flour, 9g active dry yeast, 3g fine sea salt, 56g granulated sugar, 120g whole milk, 1 whole egg (room temperature)** in a stand mixer. Mix with dough hook attachment on low until ingredients are mixed and no dry spots are left. Then knead on low for 5 minutes.

Add **42g unsalted butter, softened** in small portions, about 10g at a time. Continue to knead on medium for about 10-13 minutes or until dough is smooth and passes the window pane test.

Proof the dough in a lightly oiled bowl for about 1 hour to 1.5 hours or until doubled in size. At the end of proofing, the dough should pass the poke test.

Line a sheet tray with parchment paper.

Punch down and divide the dough into 3 pieces. Shape them into balls and let rest for 10 minutes.

Roll dough ball into a 9x3 inch rectangle. Roll the rectangle down starting from the short side, so it forms a log. Pinch the seams to seal and close. This will prevent the dough from unravelling in the oven.

Repeat with the rest of the dough balls. Then place rolled dough seam-side down in bread pan.

Preheat your oven to 350°F.

Let rise for 30-45 minutes or until they’re doubled in size and poofy.

Make egg wash by whisking together **1 whole egg & a splash of whole milk** thoroughly.

Lightly brush the tops of the buns with egg wash right before putting them in the oven. It'll give them a nice shine.

Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 25-30 minutes until the tops are golden brown. Let cool for 30 minutes to prevent the bread from getting gummy.
