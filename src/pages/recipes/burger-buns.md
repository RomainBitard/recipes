## Ingredients

### Tangzhong:

- 20 grams bread flour
- 27 grams water
- 60 grams whole milk

### Dough:

- 120 grams whole milk (90°F)
- 9g instant yeast
- 320g bread flour
- 7g fine sea salt
- 35g granulated sugar
- 1 whole egg
- 1 egg yolk
- 42g unsalted butter, softened

### Egg wash:

- 1 whole egg
- splash of whole milk

## Method

### Tangzhong:

Heat **20g bread flour, 27g water, & 60g whole milk** over medium heat in a small pan. Whisk continuously as it cooks until it's a thick paste. Don’t walk away because it cooks up quickly. You'll know it's ready when you run a spatula down the pan and a line holds. Remove from heat & let cool.

### Dough:

Mix **cooled tangzhong, 320g bread flour, 7g fine sea salt, 35g granulated sugar, 120 grams whole milk, 9g instant yeast, 1 whole egg, 1 egg yolk** in a stand mixer. Knead on low with dough hook attachment for 5 min.

Add **42g unsalted butter, softened** in small portions, about 10g at a time. Continue to knead on medium for about 10-13 minutes or until dough is smooth and passes the window pane test.

Proof the dough in a lightly oiled bowl for about 1 hour to 1.5 hours or until doubled in size. At the end of proofing, the dough should pass the poke test.

Preheat oven to 375°F.

Punch down dough and divide into 7 pieces. Shape them into balls. Give them at least 1-2 inches apart because they'll rise. Let rest for 5 minutes so the dough relaxes a bit. Then use your palm to flatten the dough balls a bit so the dough is disc shaped instead of a perfect sphere. Let dough discs rest for 30-45 min.

Make the egg wash by whisking together **1 whole egg & a splash of whole milk** thoroughly.

Lightly brush tops with egg wash.

Bake in a preheated 375°F oven for 16-18 minutes.

Remove from oven and brush lightly with melted butter.

Let cool for at least 30 min and you're ready to slice and make burgers!
