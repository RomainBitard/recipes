## Ingredients

- 4 cups raw pecans
- 1/4 cup avocado oil
- 1/4 cup honey or maple syrup
- 1 tsp salt

## Method

Preheat your oven to 250°F.

Whisk **1/4 cup avocado oil and 1/4 cup honey or maple syrup** in a bowl until the two are evenly incorporated. If your honey is a little chunky, put your bowl of honey mixture into a bigger bowl and fill the bigger bowl with hot water to warm it up. Make sure you don't get water in your honey mixture.

Pour honey mixture into a large bowl with **4 cups raw pecans and 1 tsp salt**. Mix well so that all pecans are coated.

Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Spread pecans evenly onto the lined tray.

Bake in a preheated 250°F oven for 30 min. Then bake at 300°F for 20 min. Let cool for at least 15 minutes before eating. They're hot and won't be crunchy until they're cooled!
