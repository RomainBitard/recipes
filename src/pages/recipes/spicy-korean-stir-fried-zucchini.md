## Ingredients

- 3 zucchini
- 3 tbsp salt
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp fermented gochugaru
- 1 tsp sugar
- 2 tsp mirin
- 2 tbsp chopped green onion
- toasted sesame seeds

## Method

Cut **3 zucchini** in a half-moon shape. An easy way to do this is slicing it lengthwise. Place the cut side down on your cutting board, then chop 1/2 inch pieces. You'll get moon shapes. ðŸŒœ

Mix zucchini in a large bowl with **3 tbsp salt**. Give it a mix to coat zucchini thourougly with salt. Let sit for at least 1 hour. This will help draw the moisture out of the zucchini.

After an hour has passed, rinse your zucchini under cold water and squeeze the excess water out. You can use a cheese cloth to wrap the zucchini and then squeeze. Repeat 1-2 more times to get the salt out.

Mince your **3 cloves garlic**.

In a small bowl, mix together **minced garlic, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 2 tbsp fermented gochugaru, 1 tsp sugar, & 2 tsp mirin**.

Heat up a medium/large pan with oil at medium high heat. Throw in your chopped and dried zucchini with your gochugaru sauce. Mix well so all the zuchinni is coated with sauce. Cook until your zucchini is heated through, about 5-7 minutes.

Serve with **a sprinkle of toasted seasme seeds & 2 tbsp chopped green onion**.
