- 1/2 cup chopped onion
- 4 cloves minced garlic

## Method

Start your dashi broth by bringing **8 dried anchovies & 6x4 dried kelp, & 4 cups water** to a boil in a small saucepan. Once it comes to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 30 min. Drain out the anchovies and kelp. Reserve the broth.

While your dashi broth is simmering, mince **4 cloevs garlic** and chop **1/2 cup onion** into small cubes. Dice **1/2 cup beef or pork**. You can sub the meat for mushrooms instead or skip it entirely.

Heat an [earthenware pot](https://www.maangchi.com/kitchenware/earthenware-bowl) or any small pot with a bit of oil. Cook the garlic and onion for 5-10 minutes until the onion is translucent.

Raise heat to medium and add **1/2 cup kimchi** and diced beef. Add dashi broth and bring to a boil.

Add **1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp gochugaru, 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tube silken soft tofu** and bring to a boil again until everything is heated through. Crack **2 eggs** in when you are ready to serve.

Enjoy with rice!
