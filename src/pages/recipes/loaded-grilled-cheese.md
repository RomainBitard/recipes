## Ingredients

- 2 slices of sourdough bread
- 1/4 cup gruyere cheese
- 1/4 cheddar cheese
- 2 tbsp [Kewpie mayo](https://www.kewpieshop.com/products/kewpie-mayonnaise-asian)
- 2 tbsp [Kerrygold](https://www.kerrygoldusa.com/products/salted-butter/) butter, softened
- 1/2 cup kimchi
- 2 eggs
- pinch of salt
- fried garlic chips
- finely chopped green onion
- toasted sesame seeds

## Method

Shred **1/4 cup gruyere cheese & 1/4 cheddar cheese** and give it a quick mix.

Butter up one side of your **2 slices of sourdough bread** with **1 tbsp Kerrygold butter** on each slice. Leave the other side alone for now, you'll mayo it up when it's in the pan.

Place your bread, butter side down on a non-stick skillet or a cast iron pan. Yes, you're starting with a cold pan. Turn the heat to low or medium low. Mayo up the non-buttered side with **1 tbsp Kewpie mayo** each. When your pan comes up to a heat, about 4-5 minutes depending on your stove, flip the bread. The buttered side should be _slightly_ golden brown.

Add your cheese mixture to each of your slices. Let it cook for 5-7 minutes or until the cheese is mostly melted. Top with **1/4 cup kimchi** on each slice.

When the bottom of your bread is golden brown, about 1-2 minutes after adding kimchi, remove your slices from the pan and plate them up.

Cook **2 eggs**, sunny side up, about 1-2 minutes since your pan is still hot. Give them a small pinch of salt.

Carefully place you sunny eggs on top of your cheesy kimchi toast.

Top with a sprinkle of **fried garlic chips, finely chopped green onion, & toasted sesame seeds**.
